# yaj-bench
yet another json bench

## Why
json is hard to get small LLMs to produce correctly
missing compute efficiency on deterministic semantic casting
good toy problem for learning
'how good is my llm at producing tool-use-schema-compliant outputs' -[:annoying_subtask_of]-> 'how good is my llm at tool use'
