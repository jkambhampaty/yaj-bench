# yaj-bench
yet another json bench

## Why
json is hard to get small LLMs to produce correctly  
missing compute efficiency on deterministic semantic casting  
good toy problem for learning  
'how good is my llm at producing tool-use-schema-compliant outputs' -[:annoying_subtask_of]-> 'how good is my llm at tool use'  

## Parts
- generate json schemas with deterministic features

### interface
- manually fill in correct answers to those schemas
- visualize answers to those schemas
